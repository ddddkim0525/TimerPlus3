# TimerPlus3

Online Demo:https://ddddkim0525.github.io/TimerPlus3-copy/index.html
TimerPlus3 is a music-player like Timer! It is written completly with pure javascript and css. 
I enjoy using the tomato timer (https://tomato-timer.com/), but always wanted a bit of more customizable time sequences.So I thought it would be interesting to create a timer with interface very similar to an MP3 player, where you will have tasks rather than songs.

## Planning
I built this mini web app with 7 conditions in mind.This was to force myself to complete a project, 
rather than having multiple unpresentable prototypes.

1. The project is done in 3 days.
2. Focus on completion than perfection.
3. Make only using pure Javascript and CSS
4. Look good on first glance.
5. Responsive design for different screen sizes.
6. Seperate DOM and internal Data structure.
7. Plan first with UML, then code.

 I've spent around 9 hours spreaded around 3 days to complete this project. By setting a strict deadline, I was constantly pressured to reacess my capabilities, and forced me on design decisions on which features I should work on first, and which could be dropped to deliver the project on time. 

#UML

I've never written UML beside my software engineering course, so I drew them in my notebook, and may not be in correct syntax. I've seperated two class: the Timer part and the Task List part.

#Implementation

This project was also to review and test concepts learned from the beginner learn path from frontendmaster course. So I got to practice CSS concepts like flexbox, grids, Javascript concept such as this context, class syntax, DOM manipulation, and closure.

I dropped the shuffle feature in the end due to time constraints. This is definetly not the finaly product, and have much more areas for refactoring. Furthermore, I didn't really pay attention to any documentation. 

#Conclusion
It feels good to finsih a project, whether it is big or small. It really helped me to realize that a finish project doesn't need to be perfect, packed with all the feautures I imagined from the start to be considered publishable. I hope this will give me enough inertia to tackles larger projects, and solidify my theoretical knowledge.
